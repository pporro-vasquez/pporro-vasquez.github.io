    <h2>About me</h2>
   Back to <a href="index.html">home page</a>
     <p>
       My name is Paula Porro-vasquez and I'm curently freshman at the University of Rhode Island.
       I am in the online section of CSC 106, and at this time I'm  doing all the work asynchronously. I like to read and play pickleball, as well as listen to music and occasionally dance randomly. Currently, I am hoping to become a full fledged memeber of LASA, or the Latin American Student Union. I also expect to continue to do Mock Trial in college.. 
       My dream career is to be an attorney, and potentially concetrate in issues relating to Computer Science and the Internet. A fun fact is that purple is my favorite color, as evidenced by the fact that most of my webpage is purple.
